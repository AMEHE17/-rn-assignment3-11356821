1. **View**: A basic component in React Native for constructing user interfaces is the View. Similar to the `<div>} element in web development, it serves to organize and style user interface elements. Views may contain additional Views or user interface elements such as text or images.

2. **Text**: Text is displayed in React Native applications using the Text component. It is comparable to the web development `<span>} and `<p>} elements. Many characteristics, including fontSize, color, and fontWeight, can be used to style text components.


3. **ScrollView** : This component is used to show a list of views or other components that can be slid left or right. It's especially helpful when you have more content than the screen can hold on screen. 

4.**TextInput**:The TextInput component offers a means for users to enter text into the application. In web development, it is comparable to the `<input>} element. TextInput is a versatile tool that may be used to enter text, passwords, and numeric data. Keyboard customization, secure text entry, and placeholder text are among the features it enables.

5. **FlatList**: In React Native, the FlatList component offers a high-performance way to show lists of data. By rendering only the objects that are now visible on the screen, it is designed for rendering enormous datasets effectively. Additionally, by using renderItem props and key extractors, FlatList optimizes speed and adds features like scrolling and item selection.

6. **Image**: In React Native applications, images are shown using the Image component. PNG, JPEG, GIF, and SVG are just a few of the image types it supports. Images can be loaded via network URLs or local resources. In addition, the Image component offers performance-enhancing capabilities including cropping, scaling, and caching.
